# Text analysis on the language used on Twitter on climate change

Simple text analysis on the language used on Twitter on climate change. Twitter data were downloaded using the Twitter API in October 2021. This work was part of an assignment for a postgraduate course on Text Mining. Completed in November 2021.

The analysis was done in a Jupyter Notebook and it was used to write up a short blog post.

## Purpose of the analysis and blog

The topic of my analysis was the language used on the climate change debate on Twitter. I gathered English tweets split into two groups based on hashtags: climage action tweets and climate sceptic tweets. For climate action tweets we searched for hashtags like: #climatechange, #climateaction, #climatecrisis.
For climate sceptic tweets we searched for hashtags like: #climatehoax, #climatescam, #climatecult. More detailed references on the hashtags used to select each group can be found in the blog post. I gathered tweets using the Twitter API and a simple developer account. I collected 1000 climate action tweets and 1222 climate sceptic tweets. I explored the following questions:
- How different is the language used in tweets likely supporting climate action vs tweets likely supporting climate change scepticism?
- Is the language used by climate sceptics more negative compared to those supporting climate action?
- What are the most common hashtags used in the climate change debate?
